# Can.bots.dance



The webapp will connect to a websocket defined in the script.js file, by default this is the bots.can.dance server. If you want to connect to your own bot you will have to change it in the code.

If you deploy the package to Heroku (button coming soon) you will have to add the environment variables defined in the .env file.

You can use [this unmanaged package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t09000000ALY9) for the bot, note that the Intents are not linked to Intent sets or utterances. I can recommend the [Neuraflash Bot Accelerator](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FYDvHUAX) to add intents for frustration, about, end chat.
